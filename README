🖼️ Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch
📌 Overview

This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using a pretrained VGG19 model in PyTorch. It blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another, creating visually stunning AI-generated artworks.

🚀 Features

Pretrained VGG19 for feature extraction

Gram matrix-based style representation

Adjustable content vs. style weights for balance

Optimized using LBFGS

Side-by-side visualization (Content, Style, Result)

Saves stylized output automatically

🛠️ Installation

Clone this repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git
cd neural-style-transfer
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

Place your content image as content.jpg

Place your style image as style.jpg

Run the script:

python style_transfer.py


The result will be saved as style_prominent_result.png
